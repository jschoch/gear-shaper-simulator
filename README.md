# gear-shaper-simulator
A visualization of gear profile from shaping with a straight flank cutter

# Requirements

You need this to run the simulation https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor

# Notes
Start by editing the module, pressure angle, and tooth count variables.
You may need to play with the "clearance" variable to get a good profile.  
To compare to a generated profile you can export the blank to an STL file.  You must click the blank in the viewer to get the export option enabled.
My A axis is driven in mm not degrees, there is a "factor" variable that ensures the correct rotation factor.
